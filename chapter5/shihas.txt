Finally, reduce() is somewhat special. The "worke
r function" for this one must accept two arguments (we've called the
m x and y here), not just one. The function is called with the first
 two elements from the list, then with the result of that ca
ll and the third element, and so on, until all of the list elements have been handled. This means
 that our function is called n-1 times if the list contains n elements. The return value of the last call is the 
result of the reduce() construct. In the above example, it simply adds the arguments, so we get the sum of all el
ements. (Note: since Python 2.3    a built-in function sum()that does the same thing more efficiently
